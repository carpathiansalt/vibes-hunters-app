        question: "What is Vibes Hunters?",
        answer: "Vibes Hunters is a spatial audio social experience that lets you share music in real-time with other users. You can create \"music parties\" by broadcasting audio from your device or join others to experience their music together in a virtual space."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I start a music party?",
        answer: "After joining a room, click the \"üéµ Start Music Party\" button and select the audio source you want to share (like music playing from Spotify, YouTube, or any other app on your device). Other users will then be able to join your party and hear your music."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I play music from Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube?",
        answer: "Yes! Vibes Hunters captures audio from any application on your device. Simply start playing music in your preferred app (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, etc.) and then share that audio through Vibes Hunters. Please ensure you have the right to share the music you're broadcasting."
    },
    {
        question: "What is spatial audio?",
        answer: "Spatial audio makes music sound like it's coming from specific locations in a virtual space. As you move your avatar around the map, the music will get louder or quieter and change direction based on your position relative to the music source, creating an immersive 3D audio experience."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to download any software?",
        answer: "No downloads required! Vibes Hunters runs entirely in your web browser. Just visit our website and you're ready to start. We recommend using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for the best experience."
    },
    {
        question: "Is my audio being recorded or stored?",
        answer: "No, absolutely not. All audio streams are transmitted in real-time directly between users and are never recorded, stored, or saved on our servers. Your privacy and security are our top priorities."
    },
    {
        question: "How many people can join a music party?",
        answer: "Currently, one music party can be active in a room at a time, but multiple users can join that party to listen together. We're working on supporting multiple simultaneous parties in future updates."
    },
    {
        question: "Why can't I hear any music when I join a party?",
        answer: "Make sure you've clicked \"Join Party\" and that your device's volume is turned up. Also, check that the person hosting the music party is actually playing audio from their device. If you still can't hear anything, try refreshing the page."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use this on my phone or tablet?",
        answer: "Yes! Vibes Hunters is designed to work on mobile devices. However, some features like screen sharing for music might work differently depending on your device's capabilities and browser."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to create an account?",
        answer: "No account necessary! Just choose a username and avatar when you join, and you're ready to start hunting for vibes. Your session information is only kept while you're actively using the app."
    },
    {
        question: "What if someone is playing inappropriate music?",
        answer: "You can leave any music party at any time by clicking the \"Leave Party\" button. We're working on additional moderation tools to ensure a positive experience for everyone. Please use the platform responsibly and respect copyright laws."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is the audio quality not perfect?",
        answer: "Audio quality depends on several factors including your internet connection, the source audio quality, and your device's capabilities. We use real-time compression to ensure low latency, which may slightly affect quality compared to direct streaming."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I save or bookmark music I discover?",
        answer: "Vibes Hunters doesn't store or save music - we only facilitate real-time sharing. If you discover something you like, you'll need to note it down or search for it on your preferred music platform."
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a limit to how long I can host a music party?",
        answer: "There's no set time limit, but remember that your music party will end if you close your browser or stop playing audio from your device. Other users will be notified when a party ends."
    },
    {
        question: "What browsers are supported?",
        answer: "We support all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. For the best experience with spatial audio features, we recommend using Chrome or Firefox with the latest updates."
    },
    {
        question: "I'm having technical issues. How can I get help?",
        answer: "Try refreshing the page first, as this resolves most connection issues. Make sure your browser allows microphone access if you're sharing audio. If problems persist, check your internet connection or try a different browser."
