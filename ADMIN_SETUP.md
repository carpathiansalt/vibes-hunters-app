## Authentication

The dashboard uses password-based authentication:

1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Enter the password set in `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable
3. Access is maintained in the browser session
4. Logout to clear authentication

## API Endpoint

The dashboard uses the `/api/admin/livekit` endpoint which:

- Authenticates using the `x-admin-password` header
- Uses the official LiveKit Server SDK (`RoomServiceClient`)
- Implements proper error handling and logging
- Returns structured room and participant data

## LiveKit Server SDK Integration

The implementation follows LiveKit's official documentation:

```typescript
const roomService = new RoomServiceClient(livekitUrl, apiKey, apiSecret);
const rooms = await roomService.listRooms();
const participants = await roomService.listParticipants(roomName);
```

## Error Handling

The dashboard handles various error scenarios:

- **Authentication failures**: Invalid admin password
- **LiveKit connection issues**: Server unreachable
- **Configuration errors**: Missing environment variables
- **API errors**: Graceful error display with retry options

## Usage in Production

1. Set a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in Vercel environment variables
2. Access the dashboard at `https://your-domain.com/admin`
3. Monitor rooms and participants in real-time
4. Use for debugging and user support

## Development

For development, set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your local `.env.local` file and access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
