## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Service Worker Implementation
```javascript
// Cache strategies implemented:
- Static assets: Cache-first with network fallback
- API calls: Network-first with cache fallback  
- Google Maps: Cache-first for better performance
- HTML pages: Network-first with cache fallback
```

### Performance Headers Added
```javascript
// Security and performance headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Cache-Control: Optimized for static assets (1 year) and service worker (no-cache)
```

### Monitoring Capabilities
```javascript
// Real-time tracking of:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)  
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Memory usage
- Network conditions
- Resource loading times
```
